- 👋 Hi, I’m @snappybaboon
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code. I'm currently working on a BS in Software Development. Outside of classes, I enjoy traveling and I am overly obsessed with escape rooms!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, really! Knowledge is power!
